            <h2>React</h2>
            <p>
                React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on
                components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies. React can
                be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js.

            <p>
                AngularJS is a discontinued free and open-source JavaScript-based web framework for developing
                single-page applications. It was maintained mainly by Google and a community of individuals and
                corporations

            <h2>SolidJs</h2>
            <p>
                Solid stands on the shoulders of giants, particularly React and Knockout. If you've developed with React
                Functional Components and Hooks before, Solid will feel very natural because it follows the same
                philosophy as React, with unidirectional data flow, read/write segregation, and immutable interfaces.
